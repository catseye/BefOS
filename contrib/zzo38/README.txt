This directory contains files from zzo38's FORTH-based unreal-mode OS
project.  I'd like to convert them to NASM and use them in BefOS at some
point (because unreal mode is so choice -- if you have the means, I highly
recommend it.)  I don't know how much more work zzo38 has done on it since
he shared these with me, but these should suffice as a starting point, and
they're in the public domain.
