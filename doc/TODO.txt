Putative todo list:

Clean up the code base
Rebrand the thing because I don't like the name BefOS
Update the README
Document the entry points
Abstract "main loop" out of bekernel.s, into editor.s
Translate all tools to Python?  Or at least Perl.

Switch to unreal mode on boot

Allow editing memory pages
- "current page" also needs "current device"
- can be just the base RAM for now

Implement an actual VM for it (likely something rather befungeoid, but not Befunge)
- Execute from "current exection page"
- If "current execution page" is "current displayed page",
  also update cursor while executing
Rewrite Editor in the befungeoid VM?


Fix syscalls
- Really, you should only be able to syscall a Beeble (=Befunge-05) instruction
